# Calculate-Pearson-correlation-coefficient
This project demonstrates how to calculate and visualize the Pearson correlation coefficient between different datasets. It includes examples of perfect positive, perfect negative, and no linear relationships. The visualizations are saved in high-resolution, landscape-oriented images, suitable for use in presentations and reports

Features:
Calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient for different datasets.
Visualization of linear relationships using scatter plots with regression lines.
High-resolution, landscape-oriented plots saved as PNG files.
Usage:
Ensure you have the required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy.
Run the script to generate and save the visualizations.
Example Data:
X: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Perfect positive linear relationship with Y)
Z: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5] (Perfect negative linear relationship with Y)
V: [3, 5, 2, 8, 7] (No linear relationship with Y)
Y: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] (Target feature)
Output:
positive_linear_relationship.png: Visualization of the perfect positive linear relationship.
negative_linear_relationship.png: Visualization of the perfect negative linear relationship.
no_linear_relationship.png: Visualization of no linear relationship.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
Execute the script to generate the plots.
