# Calculate-Pearson-correlation-coefficient
This project demonstrates how to calculate and visualize the Pearson correlation coefficient between different datasets. It includes examples of perfect positive, perfect negative, and no linear relationships. The visualizations are saved in high-resolution, landscape-oriented images, suitable for use in presentations and reports.
